This is my first attempt at building a gyroscope controlled mouse using an Arduino Uno. 
This is inspired by a similar piece of assistive technology. 

Arduino has an existing Mouse.h library, but it only works for other Arduino models (and we have an abundance of Unos). 

I am adapting Prabeen Raj's work:

Right now I've set up the protocol for controlling the computer mouse using arduino uno. 
The next step is to combine this with the Adafruit 10-DOF sensor's gyroscope.
